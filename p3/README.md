## Notes for instructor

* Tests: I was able to download cypress and run it- however it didn't pick up on the spec files. Tried deleting the testing files and re-installing cypress but still wasn't working- but I did write the tests as best as I could looking at class examples. Just wanted to make note of this glitch.
