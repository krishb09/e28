## Notes for instructor

Hi Professor Susan, 

Just wanted to make a note that for some reason my p1 files weren't updating/the Vue instance wasn't running when I opened up the Vue console-
I couldn't figure out why so I just created a different folder 'project1' and transferred all my work into there.
